## Surfs Up Challenge using Pandas, SQL, and Matplotlib

For this part of the Challenge, write a report that describes the key differences in weather between June and December and two recommendations for further analysis.

#Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

W. Avy likes your analysis, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

#Results: Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

The average temperature in Oahu is 75 degrees in June while it is 71 degrees in December.
The maximum temperature in Oahu is 85 degrees in June while it is 83 degrees in December.
The minimum temperature in Oahu is 64 degrees in June while it is 54 degrees in December.

These statistics show that the weather in Oahu is very pleasant year-round and would be an ideal spot for a surf and ice cream shop. 


#Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.

Based on the summary statistics for both June and December, we can see that 75% of the values for each month are closer to the maximum temperature than the minimum temperature. This shows us that warmer and more comfortable temperatures are more likely to occur than cold and unpleasant ones. But this analysis only shows us the temperatures for these two months. If we wanted more accurate information, we should run queries on rainfall amounts for these two months, as well as wind amounts. Temperature is an important factor to consider, but is not the only important factor when it comes to making weather-related decisions.
